### 👋 Hi, I'm Emma - Frontend Dev in the Making!

🎓 Currently studying frontend development at KYH.

🚀 At the moment I am working on an e-commerce site in React, to further practice coding and applying concepts I've learnt in a classroom environment.

💻 Mastering the art of crafting engaging user interfaces using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I'm eager to learn and grow in tech!
